You should begin by discussing, in your own words, what you think “ethics” means in the context of software engineering

To put it simply, ethics to me is making decisions between right and wrong. Generally it would be favored if everyone adhered to do what the morally right thing to do is. As young software engineers we don't really think about the ramifications that the code we write could bring about. We try to solve a problem in whatever way we know how best to solve that problem. However, trying to solve a problem can create problems that we wouldn't have foreseen. We've mostly been coding for ourselves which is fine for school homework but we haven't really been thinking about what if I gave this code to an employer and what could happen. It's hard to think about the negatives that solving a problem can bring which we'll be able to see below about a guy who without thinking about it, helped a company push an ad for a drug that could caused suicidal tendicies. To me ethics in software engineering is sort of like the measure of having a community driven mentality.
