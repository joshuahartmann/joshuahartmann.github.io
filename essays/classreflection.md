# What I Thought
Coming into this class I thought we would just learn Javascript and the making of a web application. I pretty much thought that we would go through like a css framework and learn how to deploy an app online. We did learn these two things but I never gave any thought about what else we would learn throughout the semester. It hasn't been like other classes where you mostly just learn about whatever topic the class is teaching. We learned a variety of software engineering concepts in which I can say I will definitely be using going forward. We learned about open source development, issue driven project management, ethics and many more. All these different tools we used in this class for our projects I can see myself applying them in other classes. It really broadened my knowledge in computer science about tackling problems and learning to use helpful tools instead of just trying to write code to do what you need. Learning these new ways to assist me in completing my work not just in this class but for any class really stood out for me.

what they mean beyond web application development

# Functional Programming
Functional programming was a great thing to learn about during this semester. Coding with Javascript, you should learn about functional programming because of how great it is. Functional programming can be seen as being able to pass in functions as parameters of a function. This idea is seen in mathematics as well when you have multiple functions like f(x) and g(x) in the same formula. We also were introduced to a libray UnderscoreJS that heavily utilized this idea. This library provided functions that can manipulate data and can use a function that we pass in as the guide to what data is looked at. This is great because the code looks cleaner to look at, which can make it easier to understand. 


# User Interface Frameworks
During this semester we were introduced to the idea of a UI framework and were required to use one, namely Semantic UI, for our homework assignments. Semantic UI is one of many UI frameworks out there and what these are can pretty much be seen as time savers. They allow a developer to use a collection of previously built compoments that are already styled and can be customized easily. All the styles are under the same theme so that makes it easy to build a site while not having things out of place, style wise. The idea of UI frameworks is great for web app development. Knowing this, you can also take the idea outside of creating a web app and into some other project development area. Having prebuilt components that you may use multiple times is great because that way you won't have to rewrite the same thing over and over again. This is the idea behind the React library. You're not given a collection of prebuilt styled components, but instead you are given the tool that encourages you to create components that can be used multiple times. This helps to ensure that two similar components look and act the same, as you would want them to.
