Coming into this class I thought we would just learn Javascript and the making of a web application. I pretty much thought that we would go through like a css framework and learn how to deploy an app online. We did learn these two things but I never gave any thought about what else we would learn throughout the semester. It hasn't been like other classes where you mostly just learn about whatever topic the class is teaching. We learned a variety of software engineering concepts in which I can say I will definitely be using going forward. We learned about open source development, issue driven project management, ethics and many more. All these different tools we used in this class for our projects I can see myself applying them in other classes. It really broadened my knowledge in computer science about tackling problems and learning to use helpful tools instead of just trying to write code to do what you need. Learning these new ways to assist me in completing my work not just in this class but for any class really stood out for me.
