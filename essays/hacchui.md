## HACC HUI
To talk about HACC HUI you have to talk about what it is built for, which is the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC). This annual event is a hackathon focused on projects that could help the people and state of Hawaii. At the kickoff event for this hackathon, participants who are going into this solo could mingle with each other to find possible teammates or join an existing team. Most participants are students who could form teams with their friends or classmates and so with covid 19 quarantine restrictions, forming teams with people you see face to face became somethig that couldn't happen. As stated in the HACC HUI docs, "The initial goal of the HACC Hui system is to provide an easy-to-use system that simplifies and improves the team formation process for the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge.". HACC HUI is meant as a way for participants to find groupmates online since there's no way for people to meet others face to face.
