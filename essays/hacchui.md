## HACC HUI
To talk about HACC HUI you have to talk about what it is built for, which is the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC). This annual event is a hackathon focused on projects that could help the people and state of Hawaii. At the kickoff event for this hackathon, participants who are going into this solo could mingle with each other to find possible teammates or join an existing team. Most participants are students who could form teams with their friends or classmates and so with covid 19 quarantine restrictions, forming teams with people you see face to face became somethig that couldn't happen. As stated in the HACC HUI docs, "The initial goal of the HACC Hui system is to provide an easy-to-use system that simplifies and improves the team formation process for the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge.". HACC HUI is meant as a way for participants to find groupmates online since there's no way for people to meet others face to face. The documentation of the site can be found [here](https://hacc-hui.github.io/).

## Functionality


## Team Process
For this project we were split into teams that were predefined. My teammates were Issac, Joel, and Manalu. We were a mix of computer science and engineering students. The work for this system was split up into milestones where by each milestone we would finish implementing a few additions to the site. We utilized github project boards to keep track of our progress and the parts we needed to work on. The way we went about splitting up work was at the start of each new milestone we would all simply just pick with issue we wanted to work on and then start work on it. Being a four team group, this method of splitting up work was relatively simple because most milestones had four different issues and were each of similar difficulty to them. We had a group chat provided to us on Discord and so when anyone needed help we would post a message and help each other out.

For the first milestone my issue was to work on the profile. I had to make it so that first time login prompts a user to sign a participation form. After that I had to make it so that users can edit and see their profile page. They could include things such as a bio, skills, challenges, etc. For the second milestone my issue was to work on a 'Team Finder', a way for participants to search through teams, so they can try and find a team that would best fit their needs and what they want to work on. For the third milestone my issue was to work on a direct invite system for team owners to invite their group members to join the team on HACC HUI.

## ICS 414 Experience
Overall ICS 414 was a good experience. So far I haven't had much experiences working in a group and this gave plenty of experience in that. Able to see how a team process can work out and since the teams were predefined was even better because most teams I've been I got to choose who I worked with. Working with people I haven't met before was a good change because I'm mostly never going to work with people I already know. Also working on this project that is something that will actually be deployed helped give me experience in making sure I wrote code that is clean and could be easily understood by others who might look at it. I also was able to get experience with developing test code which is something I haven't done before or really gave any thought about.
