Javascript, that sounds a lot like Java, which in a way it kind of is. They both share similar features such as arrays, functions, and classes to name a few, just with different syntax and features to them. First learning Javascript I was intrigued by how you didn't have to say what type a variable or function is and how functions can return any type and take in any type. It felt like I had to keep track of how I used variables and named them so that it's easily distinguishable about their function. 

I've had prior experience with Javascript before, enough to say I'm just as comfortable using it as I am with Java or C. Compared to those two languages, Javascript is a lot more relaxed, less focus on defining types and more on just writing code in my opinion. To me I also feel that Javascript helps you to both know what youre coding and to develop a habit of using good naming conventions due to types not showing up. I much prefer coding in Javascript as I find myself with fewer errors and spend less time trying to debug what's going on with my pointers. The whole experience feels smoother and easier than writing code in other languages.

I think this athletic software engineering style is good, having a mini quiz each class helps to make sure we are keeping up with the material and it gives practice that we might not do on our own. This style of learning is definitely one that I find to be useful. Learning a new language should always be supplemented with solving new problems. So far I don't know too much about the WODs or what they will cover later on but if they continue to be small problems that will require using the different aspects of Javascript then it's definitely a good way to keep up with learning Javascript. While having a timer on and framing it as a quiz may be stressful, it really is a good measure on where you stand on the material. It helps to make you think faster and on your own instead of relying on someone else to help you out. Using the rx, avg, sd, and dnf times can be helpful to see how confident you are with the problem and if you have to spend more time on whatever it was about or not.
