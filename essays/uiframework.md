UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

UI Frameworks can be a great tool in helping front end developers create a nice looking website efficiently and fast. In fact they let anyone with just the basic knowledge of html create a good looking site without knowing the css that's behind the scenes. This is great for someone who just needs a website because it doesn't require them to take the extra time figuring out what margin to set or why their image doesnt line up. We are in a digital era where everything is online which makes having a website for your store something that is expected. I would say using a UI framework shines most for small sites like a personal webpage or general information about your store. They definitely can make it simple and user friendly to get sites looking good to be up and running in no time.

UI Frameworks such as Semantic UI are popular for a reason. They work!!!!!!!!!!!!! Simple keywords like big, menu, container, etc. are all it takes to start creating a nice looking website. Without having to worry about writing the css to fit what you are going for, 
A ui framework is great because it takes sections of webpages like menu bars and dropdowns easy to create.
