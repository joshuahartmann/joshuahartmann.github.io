UI Frameworks can be a great tool in helping front end developers create a nice looking website efficiently and fast. In fact they let anyone with just the basic knowledge of html create a good looking site without knowing the css that's behind the scenes. This is great for someone who just needs a website because it doesn't require them to take the extra time figuring out what margin to set or why their image doesnt line up. We are in a digital era where everything is online which makes having a website for your store something that is expected. I would say using a UI framework shines most for small sites like a personal webpage or general information about your store. They definitely can make it simple and user friendly to get sites looking good to be up and running in no time.

Not only are UI frameworks useful for the absolute beginner, but they definitely expand out to seasoned professionals as well. UI Frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap or Semantic UI, the one we are learning now in class, are similar to using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, such that you dont need to use them however they help in making development faster and more efficient. Being a professional, that is something you would want to take advantage of for some sites. No matter how good you are, any extra help goes the long way in making sure the result is clean and nice, and gets to the client in a resonable time frame. Not only do they help with getting the job done but with collaborating with others too. If someone else where to pick up the project where you left off, for them looking through the css and all the classes can take time and might get confusing if they try to tweak some settings. However seeing a framework used, generally there is less css used so it would take less time and effort in making changes or getting familiar with the project.



UI Frameworks such as Semantic UI are popular for a reason. They work!!!!!!!!!!!!! Simple keywords like big, menu, container, etc. are all it takes to start creating a nice looking website. Without having to worry about writing the css to fit what you are going for, 
A ui framework is great because it takes sections of webpages like menu bars and dropdowns easy to create.
