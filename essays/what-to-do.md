I went to college not knowing what I wanted to do and thought that I would take a bunch of foundation classes while I figure out what interests me. I started to lean towards business and economics as I thought it was interesting and that I could apply what I learn if I end up switching majors. So I started to take business courses and it didn't feel like this is what I want to do so I ended up not doing too well in some of them, especially accounting, and then I took a semester off in the spring to allow myself time to figure out what it is that I really wanted to do instead of wasting my time taking classes I don't like.

I ended up coming back to school with a plan to try out ICS 111 and after the first project I knew I found the major for me. Having seen the potential of what I could do, I was just so interested in learning as much as I could from switch statements to object orientation not even realizing this was barely the surface of what's to come.

Fast forwarding to now, I know what I want to major in however the field I to go into from web development to data science, im not sure yet. Video games are fun to make along with websites or apps that you can code to do whatever you want. All I hope is that after finishing this class, I will get a better insight into software engineering. About the process of developing a web app and working together with other people to make it happen. Seeing as this is a writing intensive course, I hope to develop better writing habits and skills because that's an area I see myself lacking in. I hope to continue this journey that brought me to computer science to make more experiences and figure out what it is I want to do.
