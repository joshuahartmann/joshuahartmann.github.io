## Project: UH Tips

## Overview

*The problem:* There are many random benefits given to UH students, but not many students may know about them. They could take advantage of more opportunities if given the information. Thus, students may miss out on the various discounts, benefit, or opportunity that they could have otherwise taken if they had the knowledge of.

*The solution:* The UH Tips application allows students to login and post a helpful tip that they know about that other students can also take advantage of. People can rate how good of a tip it is based on the accuracy or benefit it gives.

## Mockup Page Ideas

* Landing Page
* User Home Page
* Admin Home Page
* User Profile Page
* Admin Profile Page
* Browse tips by rating, timestamp, etc.

## Case Ideas

* New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile.
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
* User goes to landing page, logs in, browse through tips they find interesting.
* User goes to landing page, posts about a new tip they found out.

## Beyond the Basics

* Support comments on posts.
* Support more detail, such as adding pictures or a map.
* Push notifications of new posts.
