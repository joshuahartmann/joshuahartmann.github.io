When first learning to program, all the assignments and projects would be solely up for me to work on. I would give variables one letter names and have one word function names in my code because I was lazy to type more. I found myself thinking more about the solution to the problem and gave good coding standards a second thought. The code made sense to me and I wasn't going to upload it somewhere for all to see. If anything I would fix up the namings after I was finished if I was going to turn it in for a grade. In the beginning this didn't cause any problems as the programs weren't complicated or several pages and files long, however as time went on and projects would get more complex, this bad coding style started to really hurt productivity as I had to constantly scroll around the file looking for variables and what changes I was making to them as I tried debugging errors. Experiencing the pain I caused myself helped me to see the benefits good coding standards brings not only to personal projects but for group collaborations as well.

Following good coding standards has great benefits that not only improves quality but everything about a project. A great part about seeing the benefits is that they aren't something hard to imagine. You can easily find an article about the benefits of coding standards and understand why each point is a benefit without having implemented good practice in your own code. It's pretty much common sense why maintaining good practice is beneficial. The most important benefit in my opinion would be readability. Imagine someone comes to you for help with their code and they have never heard about good coding standards. You may not be able to help out because the code is all over the place. Now this person either has to figure it out themselves or spend time cleaning up the code so they can get help. Don't be like this person. Following a good specific guideline on how your code is written helps you and possibly others to be able to navigate through it. This increases efficiency because it'll be faster to find a segment or follow a variable around that you may need to work on. Being able to clearly understand what the code is doing makes maintenance become easy because you can go back to any part of the code later and know what's going on.
