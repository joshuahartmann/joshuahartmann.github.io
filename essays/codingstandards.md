learn new language, impressions, checkmark

When first learning to program, all the assignments and projects would be solely up for me to work on. I would give variables one letter names and have one word function names in my code because I was lazy to type more. I found myself thinking more about the solution to the problem and gave good coding standards a second thought. The code made sense to me and I wasn't going to upload it somewhere for all to see. If anything I would fix up the namings after I was finished if I was going to turn it in for a grade. In the beginning this didn't cause any problems as the programs weren't complicated or several pages and files long, however as time went on and projects would get more complex, this bad coding style started to really hurt productivity as I had to constantly scroll around the file looking for variables and what changes I was making to them as I tried debugging errors. Experiencing the pain I caused myself helped me to see the benefits good coding standards brings not only to personal projects but for group collaborations as well.
