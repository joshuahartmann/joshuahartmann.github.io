In computer science, design patterns are more of the template to solve problems than the solution to a problem. These patterns can be seen as a sort of history lesson. You either continue writing code, running into the same problem each time, perhaps solving it differently or the same way as before but not realizing you've seen that problem before, or you take a lesson from the past and use that solution for your future problems. Over time, people have noticed these patterns and have provided the layout to how to solve them. This is like documenting history so future people can learn from the past and not repeat mistakes so we can all be more efficient in how we write our programs. As great as it is to learn a pattern on your own, in computer science, you will be more efficient by learning these patterns instead of stumbling upon them in your code.

After learning about the various design patterns out there, I realised that I have been utilizing a few of these patterns in my own code. For instance in this class, intro to software engineering, we have been using Meteor and MongoDB to create web applications that use some design patterns that make development simpler for us. One such pattern is the model view controller (MVC). Obviously this pattern can be applied to almost every project in web development since we separate the backend from the frontend in a sense and show the user only what they need to see while keeping the state of the app behind the scenes as a user wouldn't necessarily need to see everything that's stored in the app. This is just one example of a desgin pattern I have noticed in my code and while there are many others I have utilized, I noticed that these patterns do help out a lot while writing functional programs. For current and future projects I will definitely be thinking about these patterns and if I can use any of them to make my life easier. They may be called patterns and are not something like Underscorejs where you can call a function instead of writing it yourself and actually see the code. However, they are something that should definitely be thought about and utilized wherever possible as they will make development a lot less painful.
