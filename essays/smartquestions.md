Asking a question in a smart way yields good results. It helps you get your answer in the way you want and if you asked it in an online forum it helps everyone else who has that same question. Take a look at this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34691691/reading-from-text-file-to-array-of-strings?rq=1), they divide their question into sections going through their problem, approach to the problem and their question. They are precise in what the problem is, explaining it in good english with examples. Going through their question this way ensures that other people are on the same page as them as to what kind of answers they are hoping to get back.

As for asking a question in a not so smart way, you may lose out on the help that you're trying to receive. Take this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12862624/whats-the-fastest-way-to-convert-string-to-number-in-javascript) for instance, there's barely any details and the way it's worded sounds like the person is trying to use as few words as they can. To get a good answer back you can't be lazy in the way you ask your question, asking a general question can have you replying back to people with the specifics of what you originally wanted. This can have multiple different answers and only wastes both your time and other peoples when it could have been avoided by listing the details to begin with.

Asking smart questions should be simple. All you need to really do is explain out what the problem you have is and what you need help on. Explaing what you've tried to do already and organizing your question can really help people read and be clear about what it is you're asking. Asking questions in a smart way can really help you get the answer you want and not go back and forth with someone trying to provide them with more explaination of your problem. In the end, you are asking other people for help, so help them to effectively help you.
