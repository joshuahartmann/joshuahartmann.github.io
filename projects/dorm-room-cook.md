## Dorm Room Cooks
- [View Documentation](https://github.com/dorm-room-cook/dorm-room-cook)

The goal of this project was to create a webpage for UH Manoa students to find and upload recipes that are easy to make and can be done in their dorm room. This was developed as a group project for ICS 314, along with my members Michael Rogers, Randall Berbano, Ryan Mangubat, and Jonathan Oba. We ended up with pages where you can see a list of recipes as well as search for a specific one, a list of recipes you have uploaded with the option to edit or delete it, and pages dealing with stores that are nearby UH Manoa for your grocery shopping needs. We worked on this project over the course of five weeks and due to the Covid-19 pandemic we were not able to meet up in person to discuss the project, so we were left using Zoom and Slack to communicate. As this was a new experience for us we were not as efficient as we could have been, however we were able to finish the project and make it look nice.

For this project I helped start off the recipe page and the backend for the recipes. These were later expanded upon by other group members as the project progessed. I also helped to implement the add recipe functionality as well as searching for recipes. I was able to get a search working along with filters to narrow down searches. Unfortunately a few problems arose during this time, one being my internet was out for a few days so I was stuck using my phone to look up problems that I ran into. We also wanted to get the search functionality up and running so since I did not know how long my internet would be out for, another group member started work on the search too.

From this experience I would say I learned more about working in a group with more than one other person. Working with other people is nice because when you think about all the features you want your app to have, you can see the list growing and imagine how much work it will take to finish them all. Being in a group, multiple people can work at the same time on different components, lowering the amount of work you need to do. Another benefit of group members is having someone to ask for help. Since you are working on the same project, it is easier for them to help you out since they are familiar with what you're trying to do.
