This is a project that I just started working on for me to be able to write down what I need to do in terms of my school work. I want to make something that will be simple for me to quickly check to see what I need to get done. Right now I'm planning on it to just be a todo list sort of planner that I can add, mark complete, or delete the tasks I put down. What I have so far is something I see that is useful for me to organize myself a little better but I still might add a few features if I find that they help.

This is just a small project but it's helping me to refresh on my css and React skills. Iâ€™ve been on and off with learning web development due to school, work, and other factors, so this is a nice and simple project I thought would be good to help get back into it. I plan to make it so that I can access this planner through a website so after I get the coding done I'll start learning about domains and servers which I know some basics, but haven't implemented in a project yet.
