summary: A final project I made with my group member for ICS 111.
---


This was my ICS 111 final project that I worked on with one other group member. The project we did was a small scale rpg type of game. You controlled a character that can walk around the map and fight enemies in a turn based battle. We made it so that the enemies walked towards you when you got close and after defeating a few of them, you could face the final boss.

This project was bigger than the previous two projects and it really helped me understand how it feels like to work on a, at the time, large scale project. As I was still new to programming it helped me learn how to search more effectively on the web when trying to find answers to the problems that I encounter. It also introduced me to working with people on projects as I felt that having someone else with you is a big help.
